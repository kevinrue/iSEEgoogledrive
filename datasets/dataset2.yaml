  # Raw and normalized count data for "Probabilistic cell-type assignment of single-cell RNA-seq for tumor microenvironment profiling"
  
  ## Description
  
  SingleCellExperiment objects containing raw and normalized counts, as well as
  reduced dimension representations and cell type annotations for both the
  follicular lymphoma samples (sce_follicular_annotated_final.rds) and high
  grade serous ovarian cancer samples (sce_hgsc_annotated_final.rds) as detailed
  in the paper, as well as reactive lymph node data (sce_RLN_normalized.rds).
